		/// which is called by its Create method. This test was written to ensure that a dialog is
		/// not displayed incorrectly telling the user that the requested UI language is
		/// unavailable and asking them which UI Language to use instead. If the implementation is
		/// incorrect, we don't want the test to hang because of the dialog box but rather to fail.
		/// And of course, if the test is being run in an interactive environment, we also don't
		/// want the developer to interact with the dialog, which could give a false success. So
		/// we set the timeout to 3 seconds, which seems to be long enough to let the test run
		/// successfully but short enough to prevent a developer from interacting with it.
		/// </summary>
		/// <remarks>If you're wondering why this is XLIFF-only, it probably wouldn't have to be.
		/// The SUT runs for all varieties of LM. However, in practice, there was never a case
		/// where this behavior was needed for TMX and it likely wouldn't be needed for some future
		/// l10n format either. It was written to make it so that apps that used to use TMX, which
		/// typically used the "generic" two-letter language ID will work seamlessly when the app
		/// starts using XLIFF, because crowdin.com seems to insist on using country-specific
		/// variants for some languages. (For some reason, it does allow French to just be "fr".)
